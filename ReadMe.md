Have the game Auto Save after a user defined amount of completed missions. The save will overwrite any other saves including user, mod, or mission saves so you can get stuck in a cycle of reloading and dying. I used [Cheeses AI Tweaks] by THE_GREAT_OVERLORD_OF_ALL_CHEESE as a guide to generate the Mod Settings Page and persistant user settings.
